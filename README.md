# ADHD Classification with Reliable RELIEF

Implemented the research paper, 'Classification of ADHD Individuals and Neurotypicals Using Reliable RELIEF' where I wrote the code for an improved Reliable RELIEF algorithm from scratch. Also, I implemented several classifiers for ADHD classification models. Final goal of this project is to classify ADHD where the feature extraction process uses the Reliable RELIEF algorithm. 

- The results on other datasets show that this algorithm can perform better than other feature extraction methods. The implemented algorithm will be eventually deployed as a web application to detect ADHD individuals with higher accuracy in comparison to automatic state-of-the-art classsifiers.
